# TerrainGeneration
The terrain is calculated with two Fourier series. One of them is embeded in the other, resulting in a height value. The terrain can be customized by changing the function parameters(amplitude, phase, number of iterations). For rendering optimization, the level of detail parameters can be customized, such as the minimum tesselation level.
